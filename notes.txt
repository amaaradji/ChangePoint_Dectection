(1) Data pre-processing

Dataset of sequences which needs to be splitted by time as follows:
Dateset_1 -> Model_1
Dateset_2 -> Model_2

Then, build a Val and Test sets as follows:

- Val: 2000 sequences sampled from Dateset_2 but not used to build Model_2.
- Test: 2000 sequences sampled from Dateset_2 but not used to build Model_2.

(2) Training and hyperparameters tuning

Train Model_1 on Dateset_1 and tune hyperparameters on Val.
Train Model_2 on Dateset_2 - (Val UNION Test) and tune hyperparameters on Val.



(3) Buisness Process Model


Buisness Process Model is defined as the probability of observing a given sequence (analog to Language Model).

Buisness Process Model is estimated using the chain rule as follows:
S1 = AABCA
P(S1;Model_1) = P(A|AABC) * P(C|AAB) * P(B|AA) * P(A|A) * P(A)


(4) Testing

Test the two models on Test set (above) and compute the Buisness Process Model for each sequence.


P(S1;Model_1) vs. P(S1;Model_2)
P(S2;Model_1) vs. P(S2;Model_2)
P(S3;Model_1) vs. P(S3;Model_2)
P(S4;Model_1) vs. P(S4;Model_2)
P(S5;Model_1) vs. P(S5;Model_2)
.

.
.
P(S2000;Model_1) vs. P(S2000;Model_2)


P(SXXXX;Model_1) is the first dist. [0.0045,0.445,0.4545.......]
P(SXXXX;Model_2) is the second dist. [0.0055,0.045,0.1545.......]

Compare the obtained distributions on the test sets using statistics, e.g., P-value.

(5) What baselines for comparaison?
